      <h1>A Few Words About This Site</h1>
    </header>

    <p>This website was created as an assignment for The University of Pittsburgh’s Composing Digital Media Class taught by Benjamin Miller (thanks Ben for this assignment!). We were tasked with creating a site about absolutely anything, and the goal was to demonstrate our grasp of html and css in web design.</p>

    <p>This site was created at a time in my life when, you guessed it, I was crying a lot. My original idea was simply a site ranking all of the places I have cried while attending Pitt. However, as I added the content, I realized that the nature of the site begged for a bit more. As you are viewing it today, it became a slightly satire piece on my own experience with depression and emotion, including mental health resources and the science behind the benefits of crying.</p>

    <p>I hope this site can garner a laugh or two, and maybe even point out a resource for someone in need. The whole point of Crying @ Pitt is to let viewers know that they’re not alone, and it gets better. We’re all in this together; so keep on crying.</p>
