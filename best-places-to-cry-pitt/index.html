    <p>Life is hard, but there is one <a href='the-science.html'>scientifically proven</a> way to make it at least a little better: crying. This site is dedicated to giving you tips on where, how, and why to cry. While some of this page is hopefully at least a little funny, mental health is no joke. So before we dive in...</p>

    <p>... a few reminders:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are not alone! But if you feel that way right now, that's ok too. Our <a href='resources.html'>resources</a> page has a few ideas on how to get started on looking for help and support</li>
        <li>It gets better. I swear. I promise. I know it might sound dumb, but it does.</li>
        <li>Crying is arguably great, but crying too much (excessively, uncontrallably) might mean its time to talk to a professional. Here is the <a href='https:/www.thecut.com/article/how-to-find-therapist.html'>article</a> I read when I first started looking for help. It can be daunting, but oh boy is it worth it.</li>
        <li>Just another bullet that says <strong>You are not alone</strong> Think of it this way: you are on a website that someone made solely based on that fact that they were crying so much that they felt they had enough data to tell you the best places to cry.</li>
        <li>Please be aware of <strong>triggers</strong> on this site. There is discussion of mental illness and briefly alcohol.</li>
      </ul>
