      <p>This article talks about the fact that we have  <em>all</em> been crying a lot during these trying covid times. It puts tears into three categories including removing drebris and dust from our eyes, librucating our eyes, and finally (my personal favorite) emotional crying. The article suggests that the third is potenitally the most beneficial to our health! Crying as a response to emotional or physical pain actually releases toxins and produces endorphins, as opposed to the first two types of tears which reseachers found to be 99% water.</p>
      <p>Another imporant point in here is the stigma surrounding this sort of expression of emotions, particularly in men and boys. Our society often sees crying in males as weak. The article points out the importance of letting boys know from an early age that crying and expressing emotions is not only ok, but also an important part of life. </p>
      <p>Last super important piece - this article does mention that at a certain point, crying may be a sign of a problem. Excessive, uncontrollable tears definitely warrant a visit with a medical professional. See our <a href='resources.html'>resources</a> page for a few links that may help you find someone to talk to.

        <p>This Time article written by Mandy Oaklander is best described as a brief history of the study of crying. Starting with Charles Darwin declaring tears to be "purposeless," going all the way the way to an overview of the limited, but interesting world of modern crying research. The conclusion, according to professor of clinical psychology Ad Vingerhoets, <strong>"Tears are of extreme relevance for human nature. We cry because we need other people. So Darwin, was totally wrong.‚Äù</strong> </p>

        <p>"Nobody likes to cry, especially in front of others. Crying often times leaves individuals feeling vulnerable and at times even broken down or weak. However, when it comes to crying there is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, <strong>crying offers many different health benefits that may cause some to argue that we should be crying more often"</strong> (pennmedicine.org).
