      <h1>The List</h1>
        <p> In no particular order, I humbly present to you... </p>
        <p>A far from definitive compilation of Pitt's elite cry spots</p>

    </header>

<section>
      <h2>A Cubicle on the 4th Floor of Hillman</h2>
        <p>It's quiet, a bit ominnous, and you'll be among friends</p>
        <div>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
          <li>You have to hold it in a little, this could be nice if you really need to get work done NOW and that cry can wait til later</li>
          <li>It is almost guaranteed everyone on that floor knows what you’re going through in some capacity (why else are we here)</li>
        </p>
      </div>
        <div>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Crying can be loud, this is a quiet place</li>
          <li>Having to sit in the silence with your thoughts</li>
          <li>The lighting - when you look in your snapchat camera after the cry, you may not be too excited to be looking at a down-lit, puffy-faced image of yourself</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        </div>
  </section>

      <section>
      <h2>The Middle of The Schenley Quad</h2>
        <p>If you’ve been looking for your main character moment, this grassy getaway might be it</p>
        <div>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the sun is out, it might actually make you feel better. It is also slightly harder to be sad with a tan/some freckles</li>
            <li>You’re outside! You’ve taken the big step of not being inside all day</li>
            <li>Food, food, food. After this cry, you might find yourself a tad peckish and likely a bit dehydrated. At this spot, you’re surrounded by food and drink options! A cocktail at the Porch? Some noodles from Asia Tea House?</li>
          </p>
          </div>

          <div>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Weather dependent (but if you wanna cry in the snow, more power to you)</li>
              <li>People, people everywhere. This is not a private spot in the slightest, especially if the sun is shining.</li>
              <li>Grass can be itchy</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hem's</h2>
      <p>Grab a seat at the bar and take yourself out to this tried and true spot for asking yourself <em>“What’s the point?”</em></p>
      <div>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Depending on the time of day you’re choosing to shed a few tears, this place can be pretty empty. Ideal for a weekday, early afternoon cry.</li>
              <li>Alcohol. (for legal reasons this is a joke)</li>
              <li>Bartenders - they may not like it, but they’re there for you. Or at least they sorta have to be</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
      </div>
    </div>
      <div>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Can’t go on trivia nights: people will ask you to quit your sobbing while they’re reading the questions and to keep your sad tears off their answer sheets. For your cryinng convenience, you can find their trivia night times <a href='https:/www.hemingwayspgh.com'>here</a> among other events like kareoke (thats your call)
                <li>Also, alcohol. It can make the crying worse. And if you’re already sad and then mix in an Orange Crush pitcher (or 3), you might find yourself texting your ex. Unless you want to be crying more (which this site kind of endorses, but lets look past that for a sec) you may want to pick another spot.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Cathy's 4th Floor Closet</h2>
        <p>A lesser-known, but just as effective hideaway</p>
        <p>You might be asking yourself, How do I get here? And if you have your wits about you, you may be asking, Why would I even go in there? Great questions. But if Pitt really didn't want us in there, then why is the door open? Hmm?</p>
        <p>To access this exclusive spot, get off the elevators at floor four and turn to the right towards the women's restrooms. Go down the hall to the restroom and right before you would enter, there is a goblin-esque gap in the wall to the rigth with a piece a plywood I'm considering a door for our purposes. </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Pros</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>I'm telling you, no one else will be in there.</li>
                <li>Its dark in there</li>

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>It can't be safe in there, so for legal reasons, this location is a total joke. You can go in there I guess, but do not close the door. Please</li>
                <li>Cockroaches and rats</li>

        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Perch</h2>
        <p>Feeling like you've hit rock bottom? Maybe it's time to go to the top (of campus). In between Sutherland East and West, the superior Pitt dining hall (not up for debate) might be just the spot to really let yourself <em>feel your feelings.</em>

        <div>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Food! Again, we're at the crème de la crème of Pitt dining, so while you're here, might as well make it worth the hike! Bonus points if you get here while they're still running the omlete station.</li>
              <li>Lighting. The big windows will allow you to take in some light no matter how dreary Pittsburgh is that day.</li>
              <li>People watching here is great. Grab a window seat and watch everyone walk to and from class. Might take your mind off life for a while.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>As Pitt's elite all-you-can-eat, it can get busy, especially on themed days. Want to avoid those days? I believe they get posted <a href='https://dineoncampus.com/pitt/the-perch'>here</a> along with their hours and such.</li>
              </li>
              <li>Getting there. If you're starting on lower campus, it's kinda a hike. If you need to cry and its gotta happen asap, you might nnot have the time for the 15-minute walk up what feels like a 45-degree incline.</li>
            </ul>
