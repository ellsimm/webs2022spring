      <h2>A Cubicle on the 4th Floor of Hillman</h2>
        <p>It's quiet, a bit ominnous, and you'll be among friends</p>
        <div>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
          <li>You have to hold it in a little, this could be nice if you really need to get work done NOW and that cry can wait til later</li>
          <li>It is almost guaranteed everyone on that floor knows what you’re going through in some capacity (why else are we here)</li>
        </p>
      </div>
        <div>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Crying can be loud, this is a quiet place</li>
          <li>Having to sit in the silence with your thoughts</li>
          <li>The lighting - when you look in your snapchat camera after the cry, you may not be too excited to be looking at a down-lit, puffy-faced image of yourself</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        </div>
  </section>

      <section>
      <h2>The Middle of The Schenley Quad</h2>
        <p>If you’ve been looking for your main character moment, this grassy getaway might be it</p>
        <div>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the sun is out, it might actually make you feel better. It is also slightly harder to be sad with a tan/some freckles</li>
            <li>You’re outside! You’ve taken the big step of not being inside all day</li>
            <li>Food, food, food. After this cry, you might find yourself a tad peckish and likely a bit dehydrated. At this spot, you’re surrounded by food and drink options! A cocktail at the Porch? Some noodles from Asia Tea House?</li>
          </p>
          </div>

          <div>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Weather dependent (but if you wanna cry in the snow, more power to you)</li>
              <li>People, people everywhere. This is not a private spot in the slightest, especially if the sun is shining.</li>
              <li>Grass can be itchy</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

      <h2>Hem's</h2>
      <p>Grab a seat at the bar and take yourself out to this tried and true spot for asking yourself <em>“What’s the point?”</em></p>
      <div>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Depending on the time of day you’re choosing to shed a few tears, this place can be pretty empty. Ideal for a weekday, early afternoon cry.</li>
              <li>Alcohol. (for legal reasons this is a joke)</li>
              <li>Bartenders - they may not like it, but they’re there for you. Or at least they sorta have to be</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
      </div>
    </div>
      <div>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Can’t go on trivia nights: people will ask you to quit your sobbing while they’re reading the questions and to keep your sad tears off their answer sheets. For your cryinng convenience, you can find their trivia night times <a href='https://www.hemingwayspgh.com'>here</a> among other events like kareoke (thats your call)
                <li>Also, alcohol. It can make the crying worse. And if you’re already sad and then mix in an Orange Crush pitcher (or 3), you might find yourself texting your ex. Unless you want to be crying more (which this site kind of endorses, but lets look past that for a sec) you may want to pick another spot.</li>
              </ul>

      <h2>Cathy's 4th Floor Closet</h2>
        <p>A lesser-known, but just as effective hideaway</p>
        <p>You might be asking yourself, How do I get here? And if you have your wits about you, you may be asking, Why would I even go in there? Great questions.</p>
        <p>To access this exclusive spot, get off the elevators at floor four and turn to the right towards the women's restrooms. Go down the hall to the restroom * add more text here * </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Pros</h3>
          </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
